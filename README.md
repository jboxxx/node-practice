## Getting started
- Install Node.js (includes npm)
- In the project directory, run ```npm install``` (may need to prefix with sudo)
- Once the project dependencies are installed, install gulp globally: ```npm install -g gulp```

## Running the server
- Run ```gulp dev``` to run the server at **localhost:3000**
- Note: The server will restart upon changes to .js files
